###Gluten free. Grain free. Dairy Free. Vegetarian. Paleo.###

I've recently tried to eat more vegetables and less grains in my everyday diet, and have started slowly adpating to the *Paleo lifestlye*. This is sometimes referred to as the 'caveman or stone age diet'. It basically focuses on eating whole unprocessed foods, including meat and seafood. This eliminated grains, wheat, dairy and legumes. 
I'm not stict about it and when I'm away or out with friends will eat what I feel like. So far its been quite simple eliminating things like pasta, rice, quinoa, bread, flour, cheese, cows milk (except with my morning piccolo coffee) and legumes. **But**, I do bore easily and so I am trying to keep my food exciting and tasty, but sticking to clean and simple approaches.

Here is what I came up with tonight.
