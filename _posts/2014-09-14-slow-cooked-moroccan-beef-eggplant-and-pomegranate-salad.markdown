Pomegranates are one of those exotic summer fruits that I always see at the shops, but can never find a use for in every day cooking.

I recently found a great cook book _**Casa Moro: The Second Cookbook**_ by Sam and Sam Clark that creates stunning and mouthwatering feasts from Spain, North Africa and the Mediterranean. Throughout this book there are several dishes that use the beloved Pomegranate, so I thought it was about time I gave this fruit a go.

Cutting open a pomegranate to reveal its beautifully delecate jewels is like no other fruit, and the juice that bleeds onto the chopping board is worth resucing to make a dressing or enjoy on its own.

###Slow Cooked Beef, Eggplant and Pomegranate Salad###

####_With a yoghurt and lemon dressing_####

_Recipe serves 2_

For The Beef
_2 tbsp of coconut or olive oil
200g of chuck beef or other stewing/casserole beef
1 tsp of cumin
1/2 tsp of cinnamon
1/2 tsp of chilli flakes or cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp paprika 
1 garlic clove
1 tbsp preserved lemons or lemon juice
1 tbsp of cranberries
1/3 cup of water
Salt & pepper_

For The Salad
_1 large eggplant
1/2 cup of cooked quinoa, brown rice or couscous
1 cup of spinach 
Small handful of coriander 
1 pomegranate (you will only need half of the seeds)_

For The Dressing
_1 tbsp of natural yoghurt 
2 tbsp of olive oil
squeeze of lemon 
1/2 tsp of white wine vinegar
1/2 tsp raw honey or rice malt syrup
pince of salt & pepper_

>**1.** Mix all of the dry spices for the beef in a small bowl and marinate beef for as little or as long as you've got.

>**2.** Heat coconut oil in a casserole dish and quickly brown the beef on all sides, ensuring you do not burn the spices. 

>**3.** Add the lemon, cranberries and water and cover for 1-2 hours until very tender. *I use a preasure cooker instead and this only takes around 10-15 minutes to cook the beef. Once the beef is cooked using two forks shred the beef and set aside to cool in its cooking liquid.

>**4.** Grill the eggplant on a hot oiled griddle or BBQ grill until brown. Set aside to cool. The eggplant will continue to cook and become even juicer while it cools.

>**5.** Cut the pomegrate in half and squeeze to loosen the seeds and juice. Using a blunt knife or small spoon, carefully scoop out the seeds and set aside.

>**6.** To make the dressing add all of the ingredients and whisk until the olive oil is blended into the yoghurt and no longer seperates when you stop. 

>**7.** Once the meat is cool combine all of the ingredients to a bowl, sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and coriander, then drizzle with dressing.
