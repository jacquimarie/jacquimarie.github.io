When a chocolate craving hits these are a quick, easy and healthy option and are my go chocolate recipe. They are a satisfying afternoon pick me up and evening treat.

Other than being delicious, the Choc-Coco-Nutty Truffles are packed full of protein and are **raw, vegan, gluten and refined sugar free**. So there is no need to feel guilty when you reach for a second or third..
