I've had Ceviche several times at different Mexican restaurants around Melbourne, but the cost of this dish from a resturant blows my mind.. well Mexican in in general here is just way too $$$, but it tastes so good..

So we started making really good Mexican food ourselves. 
_Fresh tortillas, real guacamole, chilli, burritos, salsa and now to try **Ceviche**._

Ceviche is raw fish that has been marinated in lemon, lime for several hours. The acid from the lemon and lime change the structure of the proteins in the fish, turning it from pink or white, leaving the fish juicey and full of flavour. 

Ceviche is great on its own or served with coleslaw, avocado and homemade corn tortillas.

**1.** Place the fish, onion, tomatoes, chili, salt, cayenne pepper, coriander and oregano in a shallow dish. Cover with lime and lemon juice. Let sit covered in the refrigerator for an hour, then stir, making sure more of the fish gets exposed to the acidic lime and lemon juices. Let sit for 3-7 hours, giving time for the flavors to blend.

Enjoy wrapped in a fresh taco shell! Delicious.
