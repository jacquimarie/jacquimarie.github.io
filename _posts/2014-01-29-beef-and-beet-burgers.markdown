###Gluten free. Grain free. Paleo friendly.


So I realise I haven't posed for over a week.. I've been enjoying my last week of school holidays which has involved little in terms of experiments in cooking, well, other than these awesome burgers.

My boyfriend loves burgers, well so do I, who doesn't hey.. but I wanted to make homemade burgers that we could eat on a regular basis and not feel guilty about.. and I was also looking for a way to make a grain free option. 

These turned out pretty banging.. and got the tick from the boyfriend as well.


###Beef and Beet Burgers###
####With portobello mushroom buns####

>Recipe for the patties adapted from [Eat, Drink, Paleo](http://eatdrinkpaleo.com.au/rosemary-beetroot-burgers-recipe/)

Serves 4
_Makes 4-5 patties_
___

For the patties: 

_500 grams beef mince
2 medium raw beetroots, peeled and grated
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 1/2 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 tbsp dried oregano
Coconut or EVOO for frying_

For the Burgers:

8 portobello mushrooms
1 tomato
4 lettuce leaves
1 avocado
___
**1.** Combine beef patties ingredients in a large mixing bowl and work through with your hands until well incorporated. Alturnatively you can use a food processor to grate the beetroot and then add remaining ingredients. Roll and mould into small patties.
*I find it much easier to do this between gladwrap, especially with the juicey beetroot.*

**2.** Heat 1 tsp of oil in large frying pan until medium hot and then add patties. I gave them about 3-4 minutes on each side. 

**3.** While the burgers are cooking prepare mushrooms by grilling with a dash of oil in a griddle pan until the juices in the mushrooms begin to appear. You can also do this on the BBQ.

**4.** Prepare stuffing for your burger and stack it up!
