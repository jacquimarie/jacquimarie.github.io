2 tbsp of rice malt syrup
3 tbsp coconut oil
1 cup of desiccated coconut
pinch of sea salt_

For the chocolate layer
_1/2 cup of coconut oil
1/4 cup raw cacao powder

___
_For the coconut filling_
**1.** Place the coconut milk, rice malt syrup and coconut oil in a medium sized saucepan. Over a low heat, stir the ingredients together until combined. If its a hot day like it is today in Melbourne, simply take the coconut oil outside for a few minutes and it will melt. Using a whisk, stir until well combined and mix through desiccated coconut.

**2.** Refrigerate until coconut filling is cooled, roughly 15 minutes. 

_For the chocolate_
**3.** Place all ingredients in a small saucepan stirring until smooth/combined. Alternatively as with coconut filling take the coconut oil outside to melt and then combine ingredients using a whisk.
