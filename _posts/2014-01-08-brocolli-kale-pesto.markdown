Returning from a week down the beach means there isn't much happening in the fridge; A few tomatoes, broccoli, bunch of saggy kale, some carrots and homegrown zucchinis that my parents brought around that morning.

Craving something fresh and quick to prepare I landed on chunky broccoli, kale and almond pesto to serve over zoodles (zucchini noodles). 

A perfectly nourishing and refreshing summer lunch full of wholesome (and even homegrown!) veggies.

###Chunky Broccoli, Kale and Almond Pesto###
####_Served with Zucchini Noodles_####

_Makes around 1 cup of pesto (4 - 5 servings)_

_1/2 cup broccoli
2 stalks of kale (1 cup chopped up)
Handful of raw almonds
1 - 2 cloves of garlic
Juice of 1/2 a lemon
1/2 teaspoon of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon of cracked pepper
1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil (or similar)_

>**Directions**

>**1.** Remove stalks from the kale and broccoli then place in a food processor until chopped quite finely. 

>**2.** If you have a mortar and pestle on hand, crush garlic and almonds until you form a paste. Add
Remaining ingredients and mix until oil combines well and pesto begins to look glossy. Alternatively, place almonds and crushed garlic cloves into the food processor until almonds are chopped, but still chunky (I prefer the chunky texture). 

>**3.** Add remaining ingredients and buzz a few times until well combined.

Serve raw over spiralled zucchini (I use a julienne peeler to do this) or cook it in a pan over a medium flame with your favourite veggies, meat or pasta. Adds flavour and some sneaky veggies to almost anything. 


Store pesto in an airtight jar in the fridge for 3-4 days.
