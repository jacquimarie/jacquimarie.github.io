An abundance of fresh eggs from our hens calls for silky smooth pasta. If you have a little time on your hands, are willing to  use some muscle and know what good pasta should taste like, this recipe is worth a go. 

Fresh egg pasta that is made with simple quality ingredients and a little love and attention is second to none and is worth that extra time and effort to prepare. 

I actually find it quite therapeudic once you are at the rolling stage and you have worked your ass off kneading the dough. Seeing it stretch and form silky strands of fettuccine pasta from simply eggs and flour is pretty amazing.

>**1.** Place flour and salt on a bench and make a well in the middle. Crack eggs into the well and whisk gently to ensure they don't spill over the edge of the flour (which is what happened to me and it gets messy!)

>**2.** Using your fingertips gradually add flour to the egg mixture, aiming to create a breadcrumb like texture. 

>_If you have a food processor you can eliminate a lot of time by placing the flour in the food processor and with the motor running add the eggs. This will get you to the breadcrumb stage in no time!_ 

>**3.** Gather all of the dough into a ball, roll up those sleeves and begin kneading your ass off until it begins to spring back and takes on a smooth and silky consistency. This will take roughly 10 minutes but you'll know when your there.

>**4.** Place dough at room temperature in clingwrap for at least 30 minutes. 

>**5.** Follow instructions on your individual pasta machine and if you don't have one, don't worry, a rolling pin and sharp knife will still make perfectly tasty pasta.

>**6.** Cook in boiling salted water for 2 minutes. Drain and serve. 

Add the pasta to your favourite sauce and serve immedietly. You'll never want to go back to dried pasta again!
